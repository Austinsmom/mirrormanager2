<h2>Fedora Public Active Mirrors</h2>

<p>
Fedora is distributed to millions of systems globally.
This would not be possible without the donations of time, disk space, and
bandwidth by hundreds of volunteer system administrators and their companies
or institutions.
Your fast download experience is made possible by these donations.
</p>

<p>
To become a public Fedora mirror, please see our wiki page on Mirroring.

You may trim the selection through the links on the right,
or see the whole list.

<p>
I2 means both Internet2 and its peer high speed research and development
networks globally.

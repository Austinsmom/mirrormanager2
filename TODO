* add Directory FK to HostCategoryDir
* Let report_mirror work from behind an http proxy.  It presently
  doesn't try to connect to the proxy server.
* handle download.fp.o
* do xmlrpc between report_mirrorlist.py and mirrormanager so we don't
  need a file in /tmp.
* Designate a way for mirrors to claim themselves to be always
  up-to-date.  Probably will require a sysadmin to set this bit, as
  it's somewhat dangerous.  But there are cases, e.g. a local
  out-of-line squid proxy, where it makes sense to do it.  This change
  will change the schema, and has repercussions throughout the code,
  so I haven't wanted to make it lightly.

* Some people want metalink support.  Conceptually it's possible, and
  even pretty easy once we've got the daemon above working right.  But
  as noted on f-d-l, it's been 10 weeks since someone asked for it and
  even sent some code that doesn't quite integrate but was a starting
  point, and I haven't had time to get to it.  It's not looking good
  for me to add that right now, but I'd be happy to review patches.

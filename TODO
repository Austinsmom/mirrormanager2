* Let report_mirror work from behind an http proxy.  It presently
  doesn't try to connect to the proxy server.
  - httplib + libcurl please

* send emails to mirror admins when their servers drop out of the
  mirrorlists, with why.

* push mirroring.  Shell out to remote servers when content is changed on the master, to trigger them into syncing.

* only repositories are using the ordered_mirrorlist field, not say iso/ directories.  Do we care?

* Track multiple master mirrors (e.g. secondary arches)
  - done via separate directory trees (e.g. pub/fedora and pub/secondary) right now

* sort publiclist chooser versions

* cronjob to mark private mirrors as not-up2date, some amount of time
  after the content has changed but they haven't run report_mirror.

* can the crawler check private, but serving I2 clients, mirrors?

* make the 7-day stale  repomd.xml file timeout be configurable in
  prod.cfg.


* RepositoryRedirects
- at the end of the release cycle, the fedora-release package may have
  a version name like 10.93, but updates are available under version
  named 11.  The redirects which manage-repo-redirects puts into place
  will make redirects from f10.93 -> rawhide, which are in place early
  in the process, now need to change to be f10.93 -> f11.

- at the end of the release cycle, fedora-release may have a version
  name of 'rawhide'.  Need to put these redirects into place then:

fedora-source-rawhide => rawhide-source
fedora-debug-rawhide => rawhide-debug
fedora-rawhide => rawhide
updates-testing-debug-frawhide => updates-testing-debug-f11
updates-testing-source-frawhide => updates-testing-source-f11
updates-released-frawhide => updates-released-f11
updates-testing-frawhide => updates-testing-f11
updates-released-source-frawhide => updates-released-source-f11
updates-released-debug-frawhide => updates-released-debug-f11

* metalinks for multiple CDs/files
- Just like torrents, we should have a single metalink that downloads
all the CDs in a set via one URL.

* Torrents
In Fedora 12 or 13, the master directory layout may change such that it
matches the torrent layouts.  When this happens, the .torrent files
will be in the tree.  Include them in the proper metalinks.

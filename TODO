* Let report_mirror work from behind an http proxy.  It presently
  doesn't try to connect to the proxy server.
  - httplib + libcurl please

* send emails to mirror admins when their servers drop out of the
  mirrorlists, with why.

* push mirroring.  Shell out to remote servers when content is changed on the master, to trigger them into syncing.

* only repositories are using the ordered_mirrorlist field, not say iso/ directories.  Do we care?

* Track multiple master mirrors (e.g. secondary arches)
  - done via separate directory trees (e.g. pub/fedora and pub/secondary) right now

* sort publiclist chooser versions

Short Term:

* make sure host_location and file_detail_file_group tables get
  created correctly (e.g. have an ID column).

* add metalink/HTTP support, handy for what otherwise is a redirect to a single mirror

* Better theming support.  Right now it's very Fedora-centric in the
  UI, and there are various "if project==rpmfusion" kinds of things
  scattered throughout. Ugly.  Make it easy to point to custom css and
  custom theme, so the Fedora theme becomes just separate theme.



Long Term:

* Let report_mirror work from behind an http proxy.  It presently
  doesn't try to connect to the proxy server.
  - httplib + libcurl please

* send emails to mirror admins when their servers drop out of the
  mirrorlists, with why.

* push mirroring.  Shell out to remote servers when content is changed on the master, to trigger them into syncing.

* only repositories are using the ordered_mirrorlist field, not say iso/ directories.  Do we care?

* cronjob to mark private mirrors as not-up2date, some amount of time
  after the content has changed but they haven't run report_mirror.

* metalinks for multiple CDs/files
- Just like torrents, we should have a single metalink that downloads
all the CDs in a set via one URL.

* replace kid templates with genshi

* add Directory FK to HostCategoryDir

* Let report_mirror work from behind an http proxy.  It presently
  doesn't try to connect to the proxy server.
  - httplib + libcurl please

* do xmlrpc between report_mirrorlist.py and mirrormanager so we don't
  need a file in /tmp.

* Some people want metalink support.  Conceptually it's possible, and
  even pretty easy once we've got the daemon above working right.  But
  as noted on f-d-l, it's been 10 weeks since someone asked for it and
  even sent some code that doesn't quite integrate but was a starting
  point, and I haven't had time to get to it.  It's not looking good
  for me to add that right now, but I'd be happy to review patches.

* send emails to mirror admins when their servers drop out of the
  mirrorlists

* Track multiple master mirrors (e.g. secondary arches)
  - done via separate directory trees (e.g. pub/fedora and pub/secondary) right nowa

* per-repository source dir repositories

* primary/secondary arch distinction

* weighted probabilities of getting a particular mirror, by available
  bandwidth. This will let lower-bandwidth mirrors get chosen less
  often.

* push mirroring

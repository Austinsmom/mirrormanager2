* Let report_mirror work from behind an http proxy.  It presently
  doesn't try to connect to the proxy server.
  - httplib + libcurl please

* do xmlrpc between report_mirrorlist.py and mirrormanager so we don't
  need a file in /tmp.

* send emails to mirror admins when their servers drop out of the
  mirrorlists, with why.

* Track multiple master mirrors (e.g. secondary arches)
  - done via separate directory trees (e.g. pub/fedora and pub/secondary) right now

* per-repository source dir repositories, as secondary arches don't all use the main SRPMS dir :-(

* primary/secondary arch distinction

* push mirroring.  Shell out to remote servers when content is changed on the master, to trigger them into syncing.

* on security branch, we are no longer trimming out non-preferred URL
  methods before handing the list off as mirrorlist_cache.  This means
  much later, when shuffled, we shuffle both preferred and
  non-preferred methods for the same host, which isn't really what we
  want.  Fix this.

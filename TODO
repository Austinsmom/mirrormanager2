* Let report_mirror work from behind an http proxy.  It presently
  doesn't try to connect to the proxy server.
  - httplib + libcurl please

* do xmlrpc between report_mirrorlist.py and mirrormanager so we don't
  need a file in /tmp.

* Some people want metalink support.  Conceptually it's possible, but
  as noted on f-d-l, it's been a year or more since someone asked for
  it and even sent some code that doesn't quite integrate but was a
  starting point, and I haven't had time to get to it.  It's not
  looking good for me to add that right now, but I'd be happy to
  review patches.

* send emails to mirror admins when their servers drop out of the
  mirrorlists, with why.

* Track multiple master mirrors (e.g. secondary arches)
  - done via separate directory trees (e.g. pub/fedora and pub/secondary) right now

* per-repository source dir repositories, as secondary arches don't all use the main SRPMS dir :-(

* primary/secondary arch distinction

* weighted probabilities of getting a particular mirror, by available
  bandwidth. This will let lower-bandwidth mirrors get chosen less
  often.

* push mirroring.  Shell out to remote servers when content is changed on the master, to trigger them into syncing.

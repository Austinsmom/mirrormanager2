Short Term:

* make sure host_location and file_detail_file_group tables get
  created correctly (e.g. have an ID column).

* add metalink/HTTP support, handy for what otherwise is a redirect to a single mirror

* move Fedora-specific apps into a server/fedora directory, add /usr/share/mirrormanager/server to sys.path.
* crawlers failing after a 90min timeout - why?

Long Term:

* send emails to mirror admins when their servers drop out of the
  mirrorlists, with why.

* push mirroring.  Shell out to remote servers when content is changed on the master, to trigger them into syncing.

* cronjob to mark private mirrors as not-up2date, some amount of time
  after the content has changed but they haven't run report_mirror.

* metalinks for multiple CDs/files
- Just like torrents, we should have a single metalink that downloads
all the CDs in a set via one URL.

* replace kid templates with genshi

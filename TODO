* Let report_mirror work from behind an http proxy.  It presently
  doesn't try to connect to the proxy server.
  - httplib + libcurl please

* send emails to mirror admins when their servers drop out of the
  mirrorlists, with why.

* push mirroring.  Shell out to remote servers when content is changed on the master, to trigger them into syncing.

* only repositories are using the ordered_mirrorlist field, not say iso/ directories.  Do we care?

* Track multiple master mirrors (e.g. secondary arches)
  - done via separate directory trees (e.g. pub/fedora and pub/secondary) right now

* cronjob to mark private mirrors as not-up2date, some amount of time
  after the content has changed but they haven't run report_mirror.

* metalinks for multiple CDs/files
- Just like torrents, we should have a single metalink that downloads
all the CDs in a set via one URL.

* Torrents
In Fedora 12 or 13, the master directory layout may change such that it
matches the torrent layouts.  When this happens, the .torrent files
will be in the tree.  Include them in the proper metalinks.

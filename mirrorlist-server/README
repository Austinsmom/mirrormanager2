mirrorlist_server.py is the daemon process that has the cached data,
and fork()s for every request.

mirrorlist_client.wsgi is the apache process, running under mod_wsgi,
that takes the request, connects to mirrorlist_server.py, gets a
response and passes it back to the user.

mirrorlist_client.py is the same, but older and uses mod_python.
mod_python and mod_wsgi don't interact well, and all the other FI TG
apps are using mod_wsgi now, so I had to convert this code to create
.wsgi.  This app will go away soon.

mirrorlist_server_test.py was a hack late one night to throw requests
at the server rapidly and randomly.  Found quite a few bugs with it,
so haven't erased it yet.

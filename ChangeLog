unreleased - 1.x-dev (branched by BJ Dierkes with intention to merge)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Developer: BJ Dierkes     

 -  Cleaned up ./server/setup.py a bit.  GeoIP is now pygeoip
    in the cheezeshop, and also requires SQLObject since TurboGears 
    doesn't explicitly require it via RPM.
 -  Added a "confirm deletion" wrapper around the 
    SimpleDbObjectController.delete() function.
 -  Moved Admin View to navigation pane.
 -  Moved 'help related' text from main welcome page to a help page
    for cleaner look.
 -  Added length parameter to all UnicodeCol definitions in 
    mirrormanager/model.py.  Resolves trac ticket #20 UnicodeCol 
    definitions require length to be set (for MySQLdb)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Developer: BJ Dierkes     

 -  Cleaned up ./server/setup.py a bit.  GeoIP is now pygeoip
    in the cheezeshop, and also require SQLObject since TurboGears 
    doesn't explicitly require it via RPM.
 -  Added a "confirm deletion" wrapper around the 
    SimpleDbObjectController.delete() function.
 -  Moved Admin View to navigation pane.
 -  Moved 'help related' text from main welcome page to a help page
    for cleaner look.
